        <p>It's a honor being here studying this semester with this magnificent group of<br>
        good people. This is a great opportunity to grow and gite a better life to my family. <br>
    I live in Venezuela, born in Guarenas, Miranda State. Married to a beautiful woman with 3 wonderful children.<br>
     I served a full-time mission, the best ever time in my life to feel the Spirit so close every day.<br>
    Anyways, I hope we may meet each other and as well. I post a pic of my family of last Christmas. </p>
    <p><strong>This is my family:</strong></p>
